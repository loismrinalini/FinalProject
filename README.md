# CryptoCurrencyAnalysis
Cryptocurrencies are used by many merchants across the globe as official form of payment. Bitcoin is still the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency around. My research looks at some of the most popular cryptocurrencies after the Bitcoin. There are many macro and micro economic factors that affect the popularity and in turn affect the price of Cryptocurrencies. This research includes a descriptive analysis, a correlation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation to understand what factors affect the top 3 cryptocurrencies. The idea behind this project is to be able to identify the top three Cryptocurrencies after the Bitcoin to see which ones would be most profitable to invest in. 
This project is written to fulfill the requirement for Assignment: ‘Final Project’ for GRAD 695-53-2017/Late Fall - Research Methodology & Writing course at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, PA.
